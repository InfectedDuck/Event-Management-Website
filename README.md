The system provides extensive capabilities for both users and event organizers, including registration, login, viewing and purchasing tickets, changing seats, synchronizing with Google Calendar and much more.

## Main functions

### User registration and authorization

Kametay Events Management System provides a convenient registration and authorization process for users. New users can easily create an account by filling out the required information such as first name, last name, age, email and password. Once registered, users can log in using their credentials.

Registration and authorization are the main functions of the system, ensuring the security and confidentiality of user data. The use of secure hashes for passwords and data verification during authorization guarantee a high level of security.

Once logged in, users can view a list of available events. For each event, detailed information is provided, including name, description, date, time, location and ticket price. Users can select events that interest them and view available locations.
